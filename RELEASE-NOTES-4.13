 │ Release notes for i3 v4.13 │
 └────────────────────────────┘

This is i3 v4.13. This version is considered stable. All users of i3 are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.

For users, there are two changes to be aware of:

1. The X server DPI is read from the Xft.dpi X resource (if available).
   Previously, i3 used to directly look at the X server’s DPI (based on screen
   resolution and physical size). Looking at Xft.dpi is more consistent with
   other software, more likely to be correct (because it’s user-specified and
   not read from possibly broken hardware information) and allows users to
   override the value.

2. It is now possible to set config file variables from X resources using the
   “set_from_resource” directive. This allows users to have a single source of
   truth for e.g. theming X11 applications (specify “*color0: #121212” and have
   it apply to URxvt and your i3 config).

For packagers, there are three changes that likely require action:

1. cairo/pango are now required dependencies, as announced in the i3 v4.12
   release notes.

2. The aforementioned “set_from_resource” feature requires the new dependency
   libxcb-util-xrm.

3. i3 now uses the GNU build system (autotools). Please see
   https://github.com/i3/i3/commit/4a52a7e9fb6fb2e1f0256b2e086cfa313f411cd8 for
   a lot more details about the rationale and what this means for your package.
   Bottomline, things should get simpler for you, though :).

 │ Changes in i3 v4.13        │
 └────────────────────────────┘

  • build: wire up version handling for non-release tarballs (as opposed to git
    checkouts)
  • build: switch to the GNU build system
  • i3bar: disable pango markup for plain-text input
  • man/i3-msg: point out default ipc message type
  • config: introduce support for specifying variables from X resources
  • config: ensure variables match on longest-length, eliminating problems
    where one variable was a prefix of another
  • config: do not count '\' in comment lines as line continuation
  • ipc: introduce a new GET_BINDING_MODES command
  • ipc: implement new window::mark event
  • ipc: add “output” to IPC events referencing a container
  • make fullscreen windows open on the output which is indicated by their
    geometry (fixes LibreOffice Impress multi-monitor presentations)
  • focus newly managed windows only if they don’t use the globally active
    input mode (fixes issues with RubyMine)
  • remove title indentation in nested containers (rationale was unclear,
    nobody spoke up when we asked about the feature on i3-discuss)
  • use the last known timestamp when calling xcb_set_input_focus (might fix
    rare race conditions in focus handling)
  • introduce the “smart” option for hide_edge_borders, which will hide borders
    when there is precisely one window on the workspace
  • handle _MOTIF_WM_HINTS changes (_MOTIF_WM_HINTS were previously only
    considered when managing a new window)
  • don’t change border style if BS_NORMAL is requested in _MOTIF_WM_HINTS
  • only add numlock fallback for keybindings where necessary (allows users to
    correctly bind keys on the numpad)
  • do not match docks in config and command criteria
  • get DPI from the Xft.dpi resource instead of directly looking at the screen
    resolution/size
  • handle _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW for scratchpad windows (for pagers)
  • set _NET_WM_DESKTOP to sticky for scratchpad windows
  • add new criteria “tiling” and “floating”
  • implement special output name “current” for commands
  • handle ResizeRequests for tray clients (fixes VLC tray icon)

 │ Bugfixes                   │
 └────────────────────────────┘

  • i3bar: fix crash when the I3SOCK environment variable is present
  • i3-dmenu-desktop: do not die on failed open
  • i3-input: properly position in non-standard cases (fixes an issue where
    i3-input would launch off-screen)
  • i3-save-tree: rename “mark” to “marks” to reflect our recent change to
    allow multiple marks
  • mouse bindings: only grab the mouse buttons that need to be grabbed
  • no_focus: correctly count the number of windows (makes no_focus work with
    tabbed/stacked workspace layouts).
  • properly close disabled outputs restored during a restart (this fixes state
    handling when RandR changes happen during i3 restarts)
  • don’t trigger bindings on window border clicks unless --border was
    specified for the binding
  • traverse numbered workspaces in correct order
  • fix transition from named to numbered workspaces in “workspace next|prev”
  • avoid setting urgency hint on content containers and above (fixes crashes)
  • don’t trigger unrelated key bindings for --release bindings
  • fix colormap handling for containers (fixes taking screenshots using xwd)
  • check output crossing on ENTER_NOTIFY to dockarea (fixes pointer jumping)
  • fix a use-after-free bug (fixes “floating enable” on single split windows)
