Introduction
============

libi3 is an *INTERNAL* library which contains functions that i3 and related
tools (i3-msg, i3-input, i3-nagbar, i3-config-wizard, i3bar) use.

It is NOT to be used by other programs.

Structure
=========

Every function gets its own .c file, which in turn gets compiled into an .o
object file. Afterwards, all .o files are archived into one static library
(libi3.a). This library will be linked into all i3 binaries. The linker is able
to eliminate unused .o files when linking, so only the functions which you
actually use will be included in the corresponding binary.
