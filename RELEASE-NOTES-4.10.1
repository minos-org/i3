 │ Release notes for i3 v4.10.1 │
 └──────────────────────────────┘

This is i3 v4.10.1. This version is considered stable. All users of i3 are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.

This release contains mostly bugfixes, but we felt it was necessary since there
are two important changes in behavior: we have reverted the pango markup
parsing by default (introduced with i3 v4.9) and the change in how the
“workspace” command behaves (introduced with i3 v4.9). Both of them broke some
user’s setups, which is not acceptable. In order to help us avoid such mistakes
in the future, please consider using the i3 git version — it is typically
stable.

PS: The v4.10 release did not contain any of the commits we meant to release
due to a human error in our release automation. Hence the v4.10.1 release.
