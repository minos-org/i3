 │ Release notes for i3 v4.11 │
 └────────────────────────────┘

This is i3 v4.11. This version is considered stable. All users of i3 are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Aside from plenty of new features, there are several changes that might result
in behavioral changes, depending on your specific configuration and
environment. As usual, we tried hard to keep the current behavior, and when we
changed behavior, we strongly believe it’s for the better.

Keyboard binding handling has been made more correct, for details see:
https://github.com/i3/i3/commit/bf3cd41b5ddf1e757515ab5fbf811be56e5f69cc
